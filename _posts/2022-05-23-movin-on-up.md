I've had an online presense showcasing my gizmos since about 2015, but only in high school did I put in the effort to organize all of my various projects, videos, news articles, and more into one spot: miles-nash.com.
Checkout [miles-nash V1] (https://sites.google.com/view/milesnash/home), which lasted me through high school and my first year of college 

This current website is the next iteration.

As someone who wants to make a career in tech, its pretty hard to justify using Google Sites as my tool of choice. So here is my first attempt at somthing that might grow with me. Now i've got to thank Github and Jekyll for making it so easy for someone with no webdev experience to throw something together. This really wasn't too much worse than google sites, but I feel like a learned a bit, and I know I've got lots of room to grow. 

Let the record show that as it stands, this site is a simplified version of the Github [Academic Pages] (https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) template. I wanted something that was simple, allowed me to host some project writeups, link to others, and maybe even blog a bit. This did the trick. As I grow as a techie, and new tools emerge, i'm sure ill be jumping onto the next thing sooner than I can finish this one. Hopefully though, I can use this as a starting point, porting over my old blogs and projects to whatever comes next.

Some things I want to do differently on this site: 
1. Give a brief description of what I am up to right now.
  * I feel like while i'm good at cataloging the things i've finished, it would be useful to have some record of what i'm focused on on a month to month timespan. Maybe website visitors can lend a hand, or get inspired for their next thing. I also hope this little blurb encourages me to update my website a bite more

2. Versatile
  * When I first made my website back in high school, I thought technical skill was the best/only thing I had going for me. I focused on learning about new technologies, tinkering on new gadgets, and pushed some of my other skills to the backburner. Now i've set out to be a good hybrid of all sorts of things that interest me. I know that over my years in college, my projects may stray far away from the technical ones of high school, and I want to embrace it. Hopefully this site offers a good space for me to share my writing, engineering, music, art, recipes, or whatever else I might dive head first into.

3. More than just professional
  * While I do more and more everyday that is completely unrelated to my professional life, I never thought of showcasing it online. Over this past year i've realized just how valuable my non-professional experiences are in defining who I am, connecting with others, and helping me see connections I couldn't have seen while just focused on technology. I'd like to showcase the other "projects" im working on, whether that be journaling, traveling, playing in the marching band, or just living life as a young person. 

4. Cut the Crap
  * My previous website and resume are full of detailed descriptions about every project I did, every challenge I faced, and every detail that I ironed out. I've found just browsing a few other personal websites that technical details get boring FAST. To reach a wider audience and actually get people to look at my projects, I want to focus on the outcome, cool photos, and any demos I have. People can always ask me about the super technical side if that's what they are interested in.

So heres to moving onward and upward, no matter how different it may feel.

Enjoy the site :)
